## 2. Introduction to MongoDB

### What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a document database that is robust and user-friendly. It integrates well with applications with its variety of native drivers available. It facilitates horizontal and vertical database scaling. 

vertical scaling involves increasing the capacity of a single server, such as using a more powerful CPU, adding more RAM or increasing storage space. 

horizontal scaling involves dividing the dataset and load over multiple servers, adding additional servers to increase capacity as required. While the individual capacity of a single machine may not be high, each machine handles a subset of the workload, potentially providing better efficiency than a single high speed server.

MongoDB also offers client side field encryption for pre-database encryption of sensitive data.

MongoDB is a NoSQL / schema-less database and emerged in the 2000's along with others like Cassandra, CouchDB, Redis, Memcache and DynamoDB. It uses diverse methods like Javascript or HTTP to query data.

Documents are BSON objects - JSON Binary objects. 

MongoDB automatically adds an _id to each document. This is a mandatory primary key for each document.
