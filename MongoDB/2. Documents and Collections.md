## 2. Introduction to MongoDB

### Documents
Documents are essentially field-value pairs stored in BSON format. 

### Querying documents

the .find command is fundemental for querying documents. It requires a query document as its first parameter. If left empty, it will query all documents by default. The second parameter is projection. This tells mongodb what fields to include or exclude in the result. You can set _id:0 to not display it in the results and title:1 to only include the title field in the returned result. 

Normalised data is divided across multiple collections with references between those collections i.e. each piece of data will be stored in a collection but multiple documents will reference it. Normalised data is optimised for writing and denormalised data is optimised for reading and has a lot of embedded sub-documents instead.

### Collections
Collections are analogous to tables in relational databases. They allow related documents to be grouped for enhanced organisation and performance. 

Sub-collections do not alter data storage but aid in query organisation.

Collections can be capped, limiting the number of maximum number of stored documents and automatically removing the oldest ones to make space for the new ones.
