# HTML & CSS 101: Introduction to HTML

## 1. Introduction to HTML

computers have their own languages - programming languages - known for their logican and consistent nature. 
HTML allows us to structure our content and bridge the gap between humans and computers on the web.

The web consists of 3 programming languages:
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - responsible for marking up the content of a website and access to a wide range of built-in browser functionalities. It is known as a **declaritive** language. Its simplicity gives it it's resilience and robustness as the browser guesses what you meant and does it's best to fix the bug itself.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) - responsible for how everything looks on the web eg. fonts, colours and even animations and interactions. If there is an issue in the CSS code, the browser will skip over that part and move on to rendering the rest.
- Javascript - allows you to create interactive elements but is quite fragile and will completely give up if something is broken / browser is out of date. 

Websites are expected to work for several years, on various browsers, devices and operating systems. The combination of these 3 languages allows the developer to achieve robustness and resilience in what they build. HTML elements are preferred when possible.
