# HTML & CSS 101: Introduction to HTML

## 8. HTML Integration

### HTML pages
begin with <!doctype html> to indicate to the browser that this is a modern webpage so use modern best practices and treat it accordingly.
next, enclose everything else within the <html></html> so that we know that the rest of the content is in HTML.

in the html element, there are two main sections, the <head></head> element and <body></body> element. The head element contains information (metadata) that will be understood by the browser but not displayed. Content is placed within the body element.

### Document head
This section includes metadata, the page title within the <title></tile> element. 
Other metadata that is usefult ot include is <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" /> so that the page is responsive and a description used for display on Google and preview cards. 
to link to a CSS stylesheet,  use <link href="main.css" rel="stylesheet">.
Note the browser will load items in the order they are placed.
<script></script> is used to include a javascript file. It is typically included at the bottom of the document but can be included in the head as well. 

### Content Structuring
 - MAIN - main content is located
 - HEADER - included at top of webpages and may include logo, site name and navigation.
