It displays the HTML and CSS separately and when you want to see more content within a tag, you can click the triangle. 

### HTML Attributes
Additional capabilities can be added to an HTML element with the addition of an attribute. eg:
`<p class="intro"></p>` is a class attribute. This name is reusable and can be used to style all elements of this class together. 
`<p id="article-intro"></p>` is an id attribute. This name is unique and is used for CSS targeting. IDs are especially powerful when used in conjunction with JavaScript. 

Other examples of attributes are "lang" for specifying the language and "dir" for specifying the direction of text.

### ARIA Roles

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) are attributes that make elements more meaningful and help the browser understand what they represent. It provides essential information to assistive technologies like screen readers, braille displays, and magnifiers. 
Setting the ARIA hidden attribute to true will remove the div from the accessibility tree while keeping it in the DOM tree. 

### Formatting

HTML was created in late 80's / early 90's. Older tags are abbreviated to save space whereas as technology advanced, it became less necessary to save space and focus was placed on code readibility and understandability. 

img tags can be `<img>` or `<img />`. Both are accepted by browsers.
