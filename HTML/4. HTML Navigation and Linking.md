# HTML & CSS 101: Introduction to HTML

## 4. HTML Navigation and Linking

### HTML links
To create a link we use the a element which stands for anchor. To this element we add the href attribute which stands for hypertext reference which contains the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of what is to be linked. 

for ABSOLUTE URLs, the full address including the http(s) (HyperText Transport Protocol (Secure)) must be used. It does not matter if it has a trailing slash or not. 

### HTML URL Pathways

When linking to another page or item on the same site, it is possible to use a RELATIVE URL. This is preferred over absolute URLs as it will work on local and testing environments as well the final production environment.

Example of Relative URLs:
**Images** and **CSS** folders are contained within the Awesome dogs folder. **CSS** contains styles.css and **Images** contains logo.gif. 
To reference logo.gif within styles.css, you can use either "/images/logo.gif" or "../images/logo.gif"

when a URL is opened in a web browser, the browser will automatically look for an index.html file within the folder and load that file first. 

### Navigation

`<nav role ="navigation" aria-label="main menu">` <br>
    `<ul class="navbar">` <br>
    `<li><a href="/1.Introduction to HTML.md">Click here</a></li>` <br>
    `</ul>` <br>
`</nav>`

for a breadcrumb trail, use an ordered list instead of an unordered list and the aria-label of breadcrumb.
