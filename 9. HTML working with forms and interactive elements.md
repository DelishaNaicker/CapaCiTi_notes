# HTML & CSS 101: Introduction to HTML

## 9. HTML Working with forms and Interactive elements

### 9. Form Fundementals

By using the semantic `<form></form>` elements, we leverage the built-in power of the browser and ensure the form is compatible with all devices and input/output hardware.

`<form>`
  `<label for="fname">First name:</label>`<br>
  `<input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" required>`<br>
  `<label for="lname">Last name:</label>`<br>
  `<input type="text" id="lname" name="lname">`
`</form>`

the input element does not have a closing tag. It has various types:
- text - single line text input field
- radio 
- checkbox 
- submit
- button
- email - verify that text is an accepted email
- password - verify that text has password specifications
- date
- colour
- file

the label element creates the display name for the form field and is related to the input field with matching "for"and "id".
the required attribute makes the field required to be filled in before the form can be submitted.
the placeholder attribute pre-populates the field with an example input.
the value attribute can be used to pre-populate the field with auto-filled data that is already known to the browser. 

the `<select></select>` element creates a drop down list.
`<textarea></textarea>` creates a multi-line text input field.
