# Databases

## 1. Introduction to SQL

### Requesting data from a database:

If you want to search for something and don't want an exact match, you can use the LIKE operator. 

 - The percent sign % represents zero, one, or multiple characters
 - The underscore sign _ represents one, single character

You can use the ORDER BY operator to organise the returned data in a specific order. The default is to organise by ASC. 

The LENGTH operator returns the numeric value of the length of reach field entry. 

The DISTINCT operator returns the unique values in that field.

COUNT will return the number of records that meet the query criteria.
