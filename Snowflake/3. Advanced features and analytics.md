### Advanced features and Analytics in Snowflake

## Advanced SQL Analytics

# Advanced SQL functions: 
Aggregate functions - COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN etc
Window functions - RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER etc
    `SELECT column1, column2, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2) AS row_number FROM table`
Analytic functions - LEAD, LAG, FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE etc 
    `SELECT order_id, LEAD(order_id) OVER (ORDER BY order date) AS next_order_id FROM orders`
String functions - CONCAT, SUBSTRING, LENGTH, TRIM, REPLACE, etc
    `SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ',last_name) AS full_name FROM employees`
Data and time functions - DATE_TRUNC, TO_TIMESTAMP, DATE_DIFF, EXTRACT etc
    `SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month_start FROM orders`
Mathematical functions - ABS, CEIL, FLOOR, ROUND, POWER etc
    `SELECT ABS(-10) AS absolute_value`
Conditional functions - CASE, COALESCE, NULLIF, DECODE etc
    `SELECT column1, CASE WHEN column2 > 10 THEN 'high' ELSE 'low' END AS category FROM table`
Geospatial functions - ST_DISTANCE, ST_INTERSECTS, ST_BUFFER etc
    `SELECT ST_DISTANCE(point1::GEOGRAPHY, point2::GEOGRAPHY) AS distance from location_data`
JSON functions 
    `SELECT JSON_EXTRACT_PATH_TEXT(json_column, '$info.name') AS customer_name FROM json_data`
Regular Expression functions - REGEXP_REPLACE, REGEXP_SUBSTR, REGEXP_INSTR etc
    ``SELECT REGEXP_REPLACE(coumn_name, 'pattern', 'replacement') AS modified substring FROM table`

# Time Travel in Snowflake
time travel is the capability to access historical versions of data within the system
historical data sets can be queries using the AS OF clause. 
    `SELECT * FROM table AS OF TIMESTAMP=> '7 days ago'`

# Zero-copy cloning
It essentially creates a logical copy that shares the same underlying data.
When a clone is created, snowflake creates metadata pointers to the existing data rather than duplicating it itself.

# Working with semi-structured data in Snowflake
- loading JSON data - create an appropriate stage for the data and specify a file format that supports JSON. 
    `CREATE OR REPLACE_STAGE my_stage`
    `COPY INTO my_table FROM @my_stage/file.json FILE_FORMAT=(TYPE='json')`
    `SELECT json_data:id AS record_id, FROM my_table LATERAL FLATTEN(input => mytable.json_column) json data`
- loading XML data - create a stage for the data, but note- XML is not supported in Snowflake. The data will be loaded as strings and can be queried with regexp_substr, substring or split_part to extract specific values based on XML structure.
