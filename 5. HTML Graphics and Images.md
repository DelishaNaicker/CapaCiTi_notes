# HTML & CSS 101: Introduction to HTML

## 5. HTML Working with Images and Graphics

### Images
4 attributes need to be included for each image element:
- SRC (source) - tells the browser which image file to load
- ALT (alternative text) - provides a text description of the image for SEO purposes or those using screen readers. Best practices when alt text is not useful is to include the alt attribute and leave it blank to show that it was considered.
- width and height attributes - these determine the size of the image. These are necessary to give the browser a headstart in knowing how to display the image given these specific dimensions before the image has even been downloaded. 

### Image Formats
Aim: highest quality image with the smallest file size. 

 - GIF - great for compressing illustrations with large areas of the same colour. It only supports 256 colours so images can end up looking pixelated.
 - SVG - perfect for logos, icons and other illustrations. it is a vector file containing directions for drawing the image and thus can be scaled without losing quality. 
 - JPG - commonly used but it is important to compress and resize appropriately. 
 - PNG - works well when you need transparency in a photograph and sometimes works better than gifs or jng for compressing certain images.

 ### Responsive Images
 HTML allows us to deliver different sized image files to screens of different sizes. The browser and operating system then decide which size image is best to display. Newer computer screens have 2x pixel density whereas cellphone screens have 3x pixel density screens.

 To provide the broswer with choices, use the srcset attribute. list the images available in this attribute, separated by commas.

 ### Responsive Width
 similar to the above, we can specify a source set of images with different widths eg 480w indicates an image of width 480 pixels. 

 ### Responsive Pictures
 <picture>
 <source media="(min-width:600px)"
    srcset = "image url" 320w>
 <source
    srcset = "image url_cropped" 320w>
 <img src="image_url" alt="" height= "480" width = "320">
 </picture>

 ### Figcaptions and figures
 figure elements are used to connect an image to it's caption. This allows AI and search engines to know that these two pieces of content are connected. Figures can also be an interactive graphic.
